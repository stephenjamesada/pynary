## Scalable Features

- [x] Create calculator mode

*Calculator Mode* will be able to be activated in the initial number prompt (w/ `cm`).
On first implementation, it will only let you add only two binary numbers and create a decimal sum.
Then, it'll be scaled to have subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponents, and use as many binary numbers as you want.
